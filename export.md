- [ ] Plan your evening
  - As you use Things to manage both your work and personal life, you’ll find it convenient to set some of your to-dos aside for later in the day. Tap the calendar button below and choose “This Evening”.
- [ ] Make your to-dos repeat
  - There are some things you do every few days, weeks, or months. Create a repeating to-do and Things will automatically remind you on the right day. It’s a great time-saver, and makes you consistent!

To make a to-do repeat, tap ••• in the toolbar below and choose Repeat.
- [ ] Convert to project
  - Sometimes you might create a to-do, but realize later that it’s actually a more complex project. No problem! In the toolbar below, tap ••• and choose Convert.

These checklist items will become to-dos inside your new project:
- [ ] Tag your to-dos
  - Tags allow you to customize your workflow in Things.

For example, you can…
• Use tags for places like “Office” or “Home”.
• Tag all your “Errands”.
• Prioritize to-dos with an “Important” tag.
• Tag the things you’re working on with “Kate”.
• Or you can invent your own tags.

To add a tag, tap the tag button below. To see all to-dos with a given tag, use Quick Find to search for it.
- [ ] Use timely reminders
  - It’s a great habit to check your Today list every morning to see what’s on your plate. But for those to-dos you absolutely cannot miss, adding reminders will give you peace of mind.

Tap the calendar button below, then tap Add Reminder, and set a time.
- [ ] Go step by step
  - Break a to-do down into smaller steps by adding a checklist. You could use it to track a daily routine, pack a suitcase, make a grocery list, and so on.

And who knew it was so easy to make peanut butter cookies? 😃
- [ ] Search and navigate
  - Finding things is super easy with Quick Find.

Collapse this to-do, scroll to the top of the project, and pull down to reveal search.

Then just start typing – the name of a list, project, to-do, or tag – and be taken there instantly.
- [ ] Swipe for shortcuts
  - Want to quickly postpone a to-do?
→ Swipe it right

Want to edit multiple to-dos at once?
← Swipe them left

Collapse this to-do and give it a try.
- [ ] Quickly add to Inbox
  - No matter which list you’re in, you can quickly add to-dos to your Inbox. Start dragging the plus button, then drop it on the Inbox shortcut that appears in the left corner.
- [ ] Drag the plus button!
  - That blue button you see at the bottom of each screen is more powerful than it looks – it was made to move!
- [ ] Sync your devices
  - Things Cloud keeps your to-dos in sync across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Go to Things’ Settings → Things Cloud to create a free account.

Even if you only use one device, you should still create a Things Cloud account – this ensures your data is always safely backed up.
- [ ] Enable the Today Widget
  - Things’ widget lets you quickly view your Today list while working in other apps.

To enable it:
- [ ] Enable the Action Extension
  - Things’ Action Extension lets you quickly create to-dos from other apps.

To enable it:
- [ ] Try using Siri with Things
  - You can use Siri to quickly add new tasks or show a list. Go to Things’ Settings → Siri to turn it on.
- [ ] Show your calendar events
  - You can connect your calendars to Things and see all of your events and to-dos together. Go to Things’ Settings → Calendar Events to turn it on.
- [ ] You’re done!
  - That’s all you really need to know. Feel free to start adding your own projects and to-dos.

You can come back to this project later to learn the advanced features below. When you’re done with it, complete it by tapping the progress ring at the top.

We hope you’ll enjoy using Things!
- [ ] Create a project
  - On to bigger things! Leave this project and go back to your lists, then tap the blue plus button to add a project of your own.
- [ ] Reorder your to-dos
  - To reorder your list, tap and hold a to-do, then drag it to where it should go.
- [ ] Plan this to-do for later
  - Tap the calendar button again, but this time, choose a date in the future. It will automatically appear in your Today list when the day comes.

Upcoming to-dos are grouped together at the bottom of each section.
- [ ] Put this to-do in Today
  - Tap the calendar button below to decide when you’ll do this to-do. Choose Today.
- [ ] Create a new to-do
